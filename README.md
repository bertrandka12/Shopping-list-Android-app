# Basic Calculator-Android-app


This project is an Android application designed to perform basic calculator functions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It supports backspace functionality to remove individual digits or operators and provides a clear button to reset both the input and result views. The user interface, developed in activity_main.xml, features buttons aligned to mimic a traditional calculator layout. Two text views display user inputs and results separately. Careful adjustments were made to the button properties (names, IDs, colors, sizes) and text view alignments to ensure a cohesive design.
